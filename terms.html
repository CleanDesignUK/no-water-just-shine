            <p>You expressly agree that your use of, or inability to use, the Service is at your sole risk. The Service and all products and Services delivered to you through the Service are (except as expressly stated by us) provided 'as is' and 'as available' for your use, without any representation, warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including all implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, fitness for a particular purpose, durability, title, and non-infringement.</p>

            <h2>SECTION 15 - SEVERABILITY</h2>
            <p>In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.</p>

            <h2>SECTION 16 - TERMINATION</h2>
            <p>The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination of this agreement for all purposes.</p>

            <h2>SECTION 17 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>
            <p>The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
            <p>These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on this site or in respect to the Service constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).</p>
